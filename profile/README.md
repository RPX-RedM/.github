# RPX Framework

### An up-to-date roleplay framework for RedM by Cfx

The vision for **RPX Framework** is to provide those making RedM servers with a new level of ease and flexibility when it comes to creating custom gameplay experiences. It has been designed to act as a more solid, simple, and purpose driven base of code compared to the other frameworks currently available.

The Lua code behind **RPX Framework** has been written with performance and good coding practices in mind. Modern Cfx practices are in use in as many places as possible - including the use of state bags for client character data, state bag change handlers for all client displays/HUD, and the latest client and server natives for as many features as possible.

The framework core has been designed and packaged to include as much baseline functionality as possible - it includes a ready-to-use IPL list for your RedM server, a handcrafted door lock list, population density controller, rich presence system, a plethora of admin commands, and much more.

## What we have to offer?
* A fully configurable, modular core with easy to understand code.
* Easily accessible and simple API to make creating custom experiences a breeze.
* Easy 15 Minute Setup with a txAdmin recipe.
* Lots of configurable base resources and functionality so you can spend more time making your server *unique*.
* Leans on the proven *Overextended* library and inventory from FiveM converted to RedM and set up to work with RPX.
* Framework wrappers, which aim to provide an interface for existing RedM scripts written for other frameworks by providing their APIs. This means that, *in some cases*, resources written for RedEM:RP, QBR-Core and VORP will work for RPX with no changes.<small> (We recommend converting your stuff, though!)</small>
* Truly *Open Source*, if you want to work on and improve RPX, feel free to make a pull request.
* Robust documentation that is always being extended
* Under **Active Development**, RPX is being updated often.
